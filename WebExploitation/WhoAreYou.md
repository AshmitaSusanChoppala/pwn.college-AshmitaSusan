## Who are you?
Let me in. Let me iiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn http://mercury.picoctf.net:52362/

### Solve
**Flag:** `picoCTF{http_h34d3rs_v3ry_c0Ol_much_w0w_0c0db339}`

Given was a website, "" which displayed that only people who use the official picoBrowser were allowed on this site. So, to change that, the website was opened in burpsuite and sent to repeater. There, the User-Agent was changed to "PicoBrowser" and sent. Now, it said "I don't trust users from another site", for this, the header field "referer" was used as "Referer: mercury.picoctf.net:52362" to refer to the same site given. Then, it said "Sorry, this site only worked in 2018.", To change this the date header file was used as "Date: Tue, 15 Nov 2018 08:12:31 GMT". The next condition is "I don&#39;t trust users who can be tracked.", so the DNT request header was used as, "DNT: 1". Then, it said "This website is only for people from Sweden.", for this, The X-Forwaded-For request header was used with a sweden ip address as, "X-Forwarded-For: 192.44.242.19". Next, it said "You&#39;re in Sweden but you don&#39;t speak Swedish?", for this the Accept-Language request header was changed to, Accept-Language: sv-sv,sv;q=0.9. After this, the flag was given.

### New Learnings
-> The User-Agent request-header field contains information about the user agent originating the request.
-> The Referer[sic] request-header field allows the client to specify, for the server's benefit, the address (URI) of the resource from which the Request-URI was obtained (the "referrer", although the header field is misspelled.)
-> The Date general-header field represents the date and time at which the message was originated, having the same semantics as orig-date in RFC 822.
-> The HTTP DNT (Do Not Track) request header indicates the user's tracking preference. It lets users indicate whether they would prefer privacy rather than personalized content.
0
The user prefers to allow tracking on the target site.
1
The user prefers not to be tracked on the target site.
null
The user has not specified a preference about tracking.
-> The HTTP X-Forwarded-For (XFF) request header is a de-facto standard header for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through a proxy server.
-> The Accept-Language request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts the set of natural languages that are preferred as a response to the request.
