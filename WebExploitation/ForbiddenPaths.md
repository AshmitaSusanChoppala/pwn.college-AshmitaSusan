# Web Exploitation

## Forbidden Paths
Can you get the flag?
We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?
Here's the website.

### Solve
**Flag:** `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5a6fcbc}`

Given was the website, "http://saturn.picoctf.net:59009/" with a field to enter the command. First, "/flag.txt" was given to execute the flag file which gave "Not authorized" as the response. Since, the file was in "/usr/share/nginx/html/", "/usr/share/nginx/html/flag.txt" was given as the input, there was still no desired output. Then, "../../../../flag.txt" was given as the input as there are 4 directories, this gave the flag as the response.
