## IntroToBurp
Using burpsuite to intercept and manage requests

### Solve
**Flag:** `picoCTF{#0TP_Bypvss_SuCc3$S_2e80f1fd}`

Upon starting the instance, the link led us to a website "http://titan.picoctf.net:64846/". Since, the first hint said, "Try using burpsuite to intercept request to capture the flag.", Burpsuite was opened and in "Proxy" tab, the link was opened using "open browser" option. The "intercept is on" option was enabled. The website asked a few details and random answers were given and then forwarded to see if any clues were there. After forwarding a few times, a 2fa authentication page was opened and a random otp was given which gave the response as invalid otp. Then, I returned back to the main page and entered the details again and returned to the otp page. This time, I deleted the line which had the otp. By removing the otp field and then forwarding the request, the server skipped the OTP validation check and responded with a page revealing the flag.

### New Learnings
-> intercepting HTTP requests and responses using burpsuite.\n
-> when we try to browse around using the intercept is on, the website loads infinitely, so therefore, we need to toggle the master intercept button to off and then load the site to refresh.
