# Web Exploitation

## Some Assembly Required 1
Inspecting a website

### Solve
**Flag:** `picoCTF{cb688c00b5a2ede7eaedcae883735759}`

Given link is "http://mercury.picoctf.net:40226/index.html". The html file asked to Enter flag to which some random answer was given which gave the response as incorrect. Then, the html page was inspected. This could be opened by right click-> inspect. I started inspecting the various tabs in it. In the sources tab, there is a wasm directory. Upon clicking it and scrolling to the bottom we can see the flag hidden in plain text. 

### New Learnings
-> inspecting a website and viewing and analysing at different tabs in it.
