# Binary Exploitation

## Your First Overflow (hard)
This challenge is identical to its "easy" version from a security perspective, but has the following changes:

Unlike the easy version, it does not give you helpful debug output. You will have to recover this information using a debugger.
For all other "hard" versions, the source code will not be provided, and you will need to reverse-engineer the binary using your knowledge of the "easy" version as a reference. However, for this one challenge, to get you familiar with the differences between the easy and hard versions, we will provide the source code.
Some randomization is different. Buffers might have different lengths, offsets might vary, etc. You will need to reverse engineer this information from the binary!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{AlUDgEYRYgAIFYm8Ldu5wv0izDT.dBTOywCM4EzNzEzW}`

First, we were asked to debug the file. Ghidra was used for this analysis which was already there in the desktop. To calcute the number of bytes required to overflow the buffer, the defined strings options were used to calculate the address of the win variable and the start of the buffer input. Then, the offset was calculated using these addresses which was given to be 48 bytes. Therefore, the buffer was overflowed by giving 52 bytes of random input which overflowed the buffer and gave the output as the flag.

```bash
cd /challenge
hacker@binary-exploitation~your-first-overflow-hard:/challenge$ ./binary-exploitation-first-overflow
Send your payload (up to 4096 bytes)!

You win! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{AlUDgEYRYgAIFYm8Ldu5wv0izDT.dBTOywCM4EzNzEzW}


Goodbye!
