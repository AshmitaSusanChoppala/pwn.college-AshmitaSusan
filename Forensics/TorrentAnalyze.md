## Torrent Analyze
SOS, someone is torrenting on our network.
One of your colleagues has been using torrent to download some files on the companyâ€™s network. Can you identify the file(s) that were downloaded? The file name will be the flag, like picoCTF{filename}
Given file: https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/165/torrent.pcap

### Solve
**Flag:** `picoCTF{ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso}`

Given file is a file with pcap extenstion. For analyzing packets, wireshark can be used. So, the file was opened using wireshark. Hint 2: You may want to enable BitTorrent protocol (BT-DHT, etc.) on Wireshark. Analyze -> Enabled Protocols. Following hint 2, BT_DHT protocol was enabled. While searching through the BT-DHT files,we find the ones having info hash in it's info column. bt-dht.bencoded.string contains info_hash was given in the filter box.Following this we can manually search each hash in google to find reference to hash e2467cbf021192c241367b892230dc1e05c0580e on linuxtracker.org which was given as "ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso" and they said the file ends in iso, so "ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64" is our file name.


### New Learnings
-> analyzing a file using wireshark.
-> The info hash is a SHA-1 hash of the bencoded info dictionary within the torrent file.
